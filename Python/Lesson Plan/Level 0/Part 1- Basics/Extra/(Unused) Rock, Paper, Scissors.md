| Step | Note |
| --- | --- |
| Introduction |  |
| Outline | * Takes player input from command line
* Generate computer play randomly
* Convert computer play from numbers to string using “if elif else”
* Compare player and computer result using “if elif” for “DRAW”, “player win” and “computer win”
* Use “while” loop to play more than one round and use three variables to keeps track of the number draws, player wins and computer wins
* Print stats at the end
* Use functions “computer_play” and “check_result” for better code readability |
