# IMPORTANT NOTES

### Knowledge points that should be covered early on but not at the moment

- comment
- meaning of ‘debugging’
- when introducing local and global variables, explain that changes to a local variable cannot be seen outside of the local scope whereas changes to a global variable is visible everywhere
- Need to better explain named argument, especially the case where you want to skip some argument and pass in a later one. This is needed in the lesson “dodge it” where we pass the “font” parameter to the turtle’s “write” method, and skipping the second and third arguments
- I have been using the word “brackets” in the entire course for rounded brackets, whereas the correct name for it should be “parentheses”. I probably need to change all.
- When talking about change the value of a global variable in a local scope, I should mention that the “global” thing at the top is called a “global variable declaration”
- When talking about event base programming, mention that the function is called an event handler.
