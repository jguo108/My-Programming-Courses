### Lesson Plan

| Step | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Explain Broadcast | * Use class break and broadcast to go back to classroom as an example.
* Usually one broadcaster and multiple receivers
* Upon receiving a message, receivers will take some action to respond.  |
| Create a ‘Dance’ button | * Add a button from library
* Name it to ‘Dance’
* Add text
* How to center text, have to change size font etc.
* Place the button on the stage
* When clicked, broadcast a message ‘Dance’ |
| Add a Ghost sprite | * When receive ‘Dance’ message, repeat 20 times and switch costume
* Problem: too fast
* Solution: wait 0.4 seconds in between
* When loop done, switch to first costume |
| Stage code | * Add sound ‘Dance Magic’ to the stage
* When receive ‘Dance’ message, play sound ‘Dance Magic’ until done |
| Create a ‘Sing’ button | * Similar to ‘Dance’ button
* When clicked, broadcast a message ‘Sing’ |
| Handle ‘Sing’ in Ghost | * Add sound ‘Chee Chee’ to the sprite
* When receive ’Sing’ switch to singing costume
* Play sound ‘Chee Chee’ until done
* Switch back to start costume |
| Add sprite ‘Frank’ |  |
| Add sprite ‘Centaur’ |  |
| Extra | * Maybe a some animation to make the button bigger when the mouse is hover over it |
