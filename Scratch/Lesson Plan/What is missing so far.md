# What is missing so far

- An introduction to blocks changing x and y (maybe when we talk about ‘move’, also mention that you can use blocks changing x and y to achieve the same effect)
- Where to add the introduction of layering in Scratch (Initially, this was done in the “Find the bug” lesson where the distraction goes behind the bug. But that lesson has already grown too long and I’m not sure if I can squeeze this one in.)
- Where to add the introduction of “turn” blocks (Initially, this was done in the “Turtle crossing” lesson when we make the hatching egg. But that lesson has already grown too long and I’m not sure if I can squeeze this one in.)
- Where to add the introduction of “go to sprite”
- Maybe explain if condition a bit better, condition, true false.
- where to add the other ways to stop a project.
