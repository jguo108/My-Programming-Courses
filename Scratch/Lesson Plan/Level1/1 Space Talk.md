### Lesson Plan

| Steps | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Introduction | * OK, everyone, welcome back. So in the previous lesson we have met Scratch and the Gandi editor. Also, we have seen some very simple Scratch blocks to make a cat moves and says something. This gets us ready to really step into the wonderful world of Scratch coding. And this journey starts today, right here, right now! 

* Today, we are going to create a very simple project where three aliens use different ways to communicate and express themselves. We all know that both animals and humans can communicate in different ways. Know anyone know any examples that you want to share with us? Doesn’t matter whether it animal or human. Good, very good. For example, some bees would perform interesting dances to tell other members about the location of food. The direction and duration of the dance indicate the distance and direction of the food source. For humans, we of course have many different languages that we speak to communicate and express. But we also have sign languages. For example, in the US, the way to say “Thank You” using sign language is to use both hands form a flat, "A" shape, palms facing inward. Then move the hands outward and slightly downward, starting at about chest level. And you can find many many more examples, from both the animal world and our human society.

* OK, enough of background, let’s take a look at what we are going to build today! So far far away from our earth, there is the planet “Terra Nova”. On the planet lives three aliens: Pico, Nano and Giga. Each has its own special way of expressing and communicating. For example, if we click Pico on the left , it says “Hello” and makes a funny sound. If we click Nano in the middle, it lifts both its arms to express “Thank you”. And if we click Giga on the right, it changes its color briefly to let us know that its thinking now. So our task today is to help them use all these different ways to express themselves and communicate with us. Right, time to get our hands dirty and start writing some code!  |
| Preparation  | * OK, first, we need go to the CoCreate World website again. Make sure you are still logged in. If not, you probably need to do it again. Once we are logged in, hover your mouse over the “Go Create” button in the upper left corner and click “New Project”. This should now open up the Gandi IDE. Right, let’s do some work to get everything ready before we start to code. The first thing we need to do is to change the project name from “My Project” to “Space Talk”. Next, we need to change the stage size. Click the “Settings” icon here, and in the Settings window, choose 4:3 instead of 16:9. And then close the window. Finally, click and select the default sprite in the sprite list. Right click it again to bring up the menu, and then click “delete” to delete it. Because we do not need this robot sprite in this project. Right, this completes all the preparation and it’s time to code! |
| Course folder | * OK, so before the course starts, I have given all of you a zip file to download and also prepared a small guide to show you how to unzip and place the unzipped folder somewhere in your PC. Hopefully everyone has already done that. If not, please let me know now because we are going to use the files in that folder. Ok, everyone got it done? Awesome, you guys are the best!

* Right, if you have unzipped that file, you should have a folder called “Scratch for Newbies”. This is folder for our Scratch introductory course. If you open it up, there are three more folders inside, Level1, Level2 and Level3. I have divided this course into three levels, each builds on top of the previous one and we move progressively from level to level. Since this is our very first lesson, we are currently at level1. Now, open the Level1 folder, and you would see a total of six more folders that go from “Lesson1 - Space Talk” to “Lesson6 - Turtle Crossing”. There are the 6 lessons that we will be learning together at this level. And each folder contains all the resources that we would need for that lesson. These could be image files or lesson notes etc. So open folder “Lesson 1 - Space Talk” You would see two folders inside, one is called “Notes”, this is where the notes or the powerpoint for the current lesson is. if you open that up, you would see a file called “Notes.pptx”. This is the lesson file with more details notes and it is always a good idea to go over it both before and after the lesson. This helps you to get a better understand of everything we have learnt in the lesson. Now, let’s get back up in the folder tree, the other folder is called “Resources”. If you open this up, you would see a folder called “Backdrop” inside. Open that up, and there is an image file called “planet.png”. Later on, you would see how we can use this image to set the backdrop of our stage. For this lesson, we only have a “Backdrop” folder in “Resources”, but in later lessons, we are going to use images for sprites and maybe add sounds to the project as well. In those cases, you might see more folders here. But here, we have just one folder for the backdrop image.  |
| Add a stage backdrop | * Ok, let get back to the editor. The first thing we want to do is to set the stage up. This means we want to give the stage a more inspiring backdrop than this blank and dull white rectangle. In the previous lesson, we have learnt one way to change the backdrop. Can anyone still remember that? Aha, yes, we can choose a backdrop from Scratch’s backdrop library. How do you do it? Yes, we first click the “Backdrops” tab here to bring us to the Backdrop Editor. Then go to this big plus button in the lower left corner and select “Choose a Backdrop”. This brings us to the backdrop library where there are a ton of existing backdrops for us to choose from. Now, since our project is going to set in some alien planet, we could either click the “Space” category to show all the space related backdrops, or, we can just type in “planet” in the search box to show all planet related backdrops. Both ways give filter our some options for us. If you like anyone, just click it. For example, say we want this one called “Space”, just click it. Now you can see that this backdrop has been added to our backdrop list and also shown in the Backdrop Editor. If we now click the “Code” tab to go back to the main editor. We can see that our stage has a new backdrop. Pretty cool. 

* However, I think I have an image somewhere that looks even better than this one! Can you guess where that image is? Aha, yes, we have just seen that image file in the “Resources” folder of this lesson. So, I want to use that image for our stage. How can we do that? Well, every time you want to  do something with backdrops, whether it’s adding a new one or changing an existing one, always click this “Backdrops” tab to go to the backdrop paint editor first. So let’s do that again. Ok, since we are adding a new backdrop, we go to the plus button again. Previously, we select “Choose a Backdrop” to choose one from the library. But this time, our backdrop is not in the library but somewhere on our computer. So this time, we are going to “Upload Backdrop”, which is little icon with an upward point arrow. We are going to upload an image from our computer to the editor. Let’s click that. Now, a window pops up. This is called the “File Explorer”, meaning you can use it to explore all files on you computer and select the one you need. So first, we need to find where our planet image file is. For me, I have put the entire “Scratch for Newbies” folder on my desktop. If might be different in your case, although I have suggested you put your folder on the desktop as well in my little guide. If this is the case, you need to locate that folder first. For me, this is simple, there is a quick access column on the left, and the first one is the “Desktop”. Now, click it, and file explorer shows all the files and folder that are currently on my desktop. I can see the “Scratch for Newbies” folder here. Double click to open it up. And there is the three level folders inside. Double click “Level1” to open it up, and there is the 6 lesson folders inside. Continue to open “Lesson 1 - Space Talk”, then “Resources”, and finally “Backdrops”. And there you go, we have found the “Planet.png” image file. At this point, all you need to do is just to double click this image file. Voila! The image file has been uploaded and added to our backdrop list! We have a total of three backdrops now! Now, since we don’t need the first two backdrops, I want get rid of them. This way you delete a backdrop is to click it first, now a small trash can icon appear in the upper right corner, then just click the icon to delete the backdrop. So let’s delete both and leave with only one backdrop. 

* Ok, now if we click the “Code” tab and go back to the main editor, our stage backdrop has been changed to the Planet image. Very nice! |
| Add Pico | * Right, the stage is set, and it’s time to bring on the sprites! At the beginning of the lesson, we have seen three characters on the planet, Pico, Nano and Giga. So it seems that we need three sprites. Let add them one by one. There three alien sprite actually come with Scratch. This means we would be able to find them in the sprite library. Let’s add Pico first.

* Still remember how to add a sprite? Yes, go to the big plus button in the lower right corner here, and select “Choose a Sprite”.  This brings us to the sprite library. The three sprites we want are under the Fantasy category, so let’s click that. And now you can see, Pico here, Nano here and Giga here. Let’s add Pico first by clicking it. This brings us back to the main editor and now Pico is added to both the stage and the sprite list.  Now, Pico is currently too close to the middle of the stage. I want to move it slightly to the left to make space for future sprites. To move a sprite anywhere on a stage, you can just click it and hold the mouse, then just drag it anywhere you want. So let’s move it down and slightly to the left. Once you are happy with its new position, just let go of the mouse. Ok, I think here looks good. Also notice that, the x and y values in the sprite properties have changed to -146 and -34. Again, we will explain what those numbers mean in the next lesson.  |
| Pico says ‘Hello’ | * Ok, it’s time for Pico to say something! In the last lesson, we get the cat to say “Hello, Scratchers!”. And it is not that much different here. Does anyone still remember how to get a sprite to say something? Yes, we can use the “say Hello for 2 seconds” block. Let’s drag it into our script area. Still remember how to run a block or a script? Yes, you can just click it! So, once we click this block, pay attention to Pico. See? It says “Hello”, and the speech bubble stays on the stage of 2 seconds then disappear. In the last lesson, I have explained what the values in the two slots are for: the first is what the sprite says, and the second one is how long to say it for. There is another small detail that I want to point out. When the I click the block to run it, there is a yellow outline around that block. And once the block is finished, the outline is gone. This yellow outline is here to make it clearer which block or script is currently running. This might now seem such a big deal right now. But it becomes more useful when you have more scripts and want to know which one is currently running.

* Ok, I have also briefly pointed out that there is a second “say” block, which is this one. Let’s also drag it to the script area. So what is the difference between this two? Yes, this second does not have the slot for seconds. So what does that mean? How does that make it different? Let’s try it. If I click it, Pico also says “Hello”. Do you notice the difference now? Yes, the speech bubble stays on the stage forever, it never goes away! So how can we make it disappear? Still remember the three buttons above the stage, the Go, the Pause and the Stop? To make the speech bubble go away, the only way is to click the Stop button. This stops everything in your code and the bubble is gone. Usually, you would want to use the “say” block with a time limit, but in cases the other say block might be more appropriate. It all depends on the situation. Here we still just want Pico to say “Hello” for two seconds, so let’s delete the “say” block by dragging it to the palette and then let go. By the way, if you feel like the blocks in the script area is too small, you can click the plus button here to make it bigger. The minus button can make it smaller. And the equal button changes it back to its default size. 

* Ok, so far, the way we run a block or a script is simple by clicking it directly. This is ok if you just want to quickly run some code and see what it does. But in reality, people rarely run their scripts this way. There are better things we can do. In this particular case, we want to run the code and get Pico to say “Hello” when we click it on the stage. Currently, if we click Pico, nothing happens, no code is run and Pico says nothing. Ideally, what we want to happen is that when Pico is clicked, the script is being notified and then the “say” block is run automatically. For this to happen, we need to introduce is new block under the “Event” category, called “when this sprite is clicked”. Let’s drag it into our script area. Now the first interesting thing I want to point out is that this block looks a bit different than some of the other blocks we have seen so far. As I said before, a block is like a LEGO brick with studs and tubes so that you can connect other blocks both above and below it. Now, take a look at this “when sprite is click block”, do you notice any difference? Yes, it only has the stud, that is the bit that sticks out at the bottom, but not the tube, that is the dent at the top. What this think this means? When you play LEGO, have you ever come across a piece like [this](https://i.sstatic.net/C8xpz.png)? Yeah? With this piece, do you think we can connect another piece below it? Yes, sure. But do you think we can connect another piece above it? Probably not, because it has a completely flat surface. This is exactly like our block here, yes, I know, its top is not flat, but the point is the same: You cannot connect another block on top of it. Don’t trust me? Let’s try to stack the “say” block on top of it. See? They would never snap. How about trying from below? Aha, yes, the two are joined together to become one single script. Now, if you take a quick look at some of the other blocks under the “Events” category, you would see that a lot of them are like this block. Of course, we are not going to touch on them in this lesson, but we will meet them properly in future lessons. Also, because such blocks look like a hat, sometime people would just call them “Hat Blocks”. Because you never put other blocks above them, hat blocks, if they exist in your code, are always the first blocks for any scripts.

* Ok, let’s first leave Scratch and get back to real life for a moment. Everyday, we often say something like “When I finish me homework, then I can watch TV” or “When the cat sees a mouse, then it chases it” or “when the sun sets, then the stars come out.” Do you see the pattern here? It’s always when something happens, then take some action. We talk like this all the time. And very often, we want to be able to express the same pattern in our code as well. In this case, what we want is, when a sprite is clicked, it should say “Hello!”. Aha, I think we have the code for this already! Right? Take a look at this script, we have a hat block that says “when the sprite is clicked”, then what’s next? Yes, when this happens, the sprite says “Hello!”. Bingo! See? These code blocks are not very different from our everyday language after all! Let’s try to click Pico again and see what happens. Aha, yes, as soon as I click it, it says “Hello!”. And notice that this script is not highlighted in yellow outline, meaning it is running at the moment. Then after about 2 seconds, the speech bubble is gone and the script is no longer highlighted, meaning it has stopped. So we have successfully make it possible to run the code when a sprite is clicked, with the help of this “when this sprite is clicked” hat block. 

* So the reason that all these hat blocks are classified under the “Event” category is because, each of them represents some kind of event. An event is just something that happens. For example, we clicking a sprite is an event, and there is another block named “when key pressed” which is for the event when a key on a keyboard is pressed. Same for the others. They are all used as the first block of a script to respond to a particular event. In this case, we respond to the sprite clicking event by having the sprite say “Hello”. Of course, as you will see later in the course, we can do much more to respond to an event than just saying “Hello”. But that’s for later, in this lesson, saying “Hello” is all we want the sprite to do. |
| Pico makes a sound | * Ok, Pico is not only going to say “Hello”, it’s also going to make a funny sound. Maybe that’s just what “Hello” sounds in their language! Now, just as you can use a block to make a sprite move or say something, you can also use a block to let make a sound! Can anyone figure out where that block might be? Yes, there is a category named “Sound”. If you click that, it brings you to all the block related to sounds. All these pink ones here. Now,  which one of these do you think is going to play some sound? Yes, there seems to be two candidates here: “play sound until done” and “start sound”. Let’s drag both into the script area. Now, previously, we have seen blocks that have one or more slots, and you can type in text or numbers into those slots to provide extra information. Here, we are seeing something different. Both blocks have something that look like slots but you can’t type things in. Instead, you click it and it gives you a dropdown list. This is called a “Menu” because it gives you different options to choose from. Here, the menu in both blocks have two options, one is called “pop” and the other one is called “record…”. Let’s explain the second one first. The “record” option allows you to record a voice or a sound of your own using a microphone. This can be useful in some cases, but in this course, we are not going to use it at all. Instead, we are always going to use an existing sound. And the first option “pop” is an existing sound and it is chosen by default. If you click each block, you can hear a very short pop sound.

* Ok, it looks like both blocks do the same thing by playing the pop sound when it is clicked. Let’s get rid of “start sound” for now. Later on, we will see the difference between them, but that’s for later. Ok, the next question is where can you find all the sounds that you can play with this block? If you take a look at the three tabs just above the code palette, you can see that the last one is called “Sounds”. Clicking that brings you to the “Sound Editor”. Previously when learning about backdrops, we have see something called a “Backdrop Editor”, right? And the layout of Sound editor looks similar to that of the backdrop editor: you have this big area on the right and you have a list on the left. In the case of Backdrop Editor, the big area is used for showing and editing a backdrop image. Here, this area is used for showing and editing a sound. There are a few buttons at the bottom, with which you can make the sound faster, slower, louder etc etc. On the left is this sprite’s sound list, like the backdrop list in the Backdrop editor. Here is where you can find all the sounds that can be played by the current sprite. Right now, there is just one, the pop sound. Just like you can add extra backdrop images to the list, you can also add extra sounds here. How? Yes, we see this big plus button again at the bottom. Hover your mouse over and a small menu pops up. Here are all the different ways you can add a sound: upload one from your computer, get some surprise, this usually means letting Scratch choose a sound for you randomly, record your own sound, or choose a sound from the Scratch’s sound library. 

* For Pico’s Hello voice, we would like to choose one from the sound library, so click this magnifying glass. Now, just like the sprite library or the backdrop library, this brings you to a sound library where you can find all the sounds that come with Scratch. The sounds have also been organized into different categories. Since Pico is an alien, I want to have some kind of creaking sound. For this, type in “alien” in the search box, and two sounds come up: Alien Creak1 and Alien Creak2. To hear what they sound like, just hover your mouse over this little triangle, then it would automatically play that sound. Hmm.. I think both sound fine, I would just pick Alien Creak1 by clicking it. Now, we are back to the Sound Editor. And notice that the new sound has been added to this sprite’s sound list. In the Paint Editor, you can also play it by clicking this button with a triangle. I’m pretty happy with what it sounds like now, so I would not edit the sound in any way. Right, we have a new sound for Pico, let’s get back to the main editor by clicking the “Code” tab. Now, if you click and bring up the menu for the “play sound until done” block again, you would now see the new “Alien Creak1” sound. Click it to choose, and now if you run the block again, aha, we are hearing the creaking sound! Pretty nice! 

* But if we click Pico now, it still just says “Hello” without making any sound. Why? Yes, because we have not connected this play sound block to our script yet. So when you click, the script still just says “Hello” for 2 seconds and then finishes. What should we do then? Yes, simple, we could just add it to the end of the script. So now, when Pico is clicked, it should first says “Hello” and then makes a creaking sound. Let’s try and see if this is the case.

* Test. Yep, just as what we expect, it first says “Hello”, and then two seconds later, it makes that creaking sound. Pretty cool! But I think there is something odd here: usually, when people say something, the words they say and the sound they make should come out of their mouth at the same time, right? But for Pico, the word “Hello” comes out first, and then, after 2 seconds, we finally hear the sound. This is a bit strange. Can anyone explain why this happens? Yes, remember, a script always runs all the blocks from top to bottom, one after the other. Let’s take a look at both the say and the play sound block again. The say block comes first, so that‘s why we are seeing the speech bubble. But why are we now hearing the sound at the same time? Yes, because it says “Hello” for 2 seconds. This means the say block is not going to complete until 2 seconds have been passed. So the script is just going to be waiting at the say block for 2 seconds before moving on to the next block. That’s why we are not hearing the sound, because the say block is not done yet! So, what can we do? Aha, I hear that some of you suggest that maybe we can change the order of these two blocks, so play sound first and then say “Hello”. Would that work? Let’s try to find out. We drag and disconnect the play sound block from the script, move it between the “When this sprite is clicked” hat block and the say block, then let go and it snaps right in! Now, we have the play sound block comes before the say block. Let’s click Pico again! OK, this time, things do get a little bit different: as soon as we click Pico, we hear the creaking sound. But there seems to be a new problem: this time, the speech bubble does not appear until the sound is done playing. We are now in a opposite situation: the word “Hello” is not said until the sound is finished. The thing that does not change is we still have the same problem: we are not playing the sound while the word is being said, they are still not happening at the same time! 

* Hmmm…annoying! Are we running out of tricks? Well, not yet! Remember earlier, we have two blocks that can play a sound, right? What is the other one? Yes, this “start sound” block. Previously, they seem to be the same, both can be used to play some sound. But remember, every block in Scratch is here for a reason. People would not have two blocks if they are completely the same. So, let’s first try to replace the “play sound until done” block with this “start sound” block and see if that makes a difference. In Scratch, replacing a block can sometimes be a bit annoying. Here, we cannot just drag the “play sound until done” block out from the script directly. Instead, we have to first disconnect the hat block with the rest, disconnect the “play sound until done” block with the say block, connect the say block below the “start sound” block, and finally connect both back again to the hat block. Phew! That’s quite some work to just replace one block. But yeah, that’s just something you have to live with. Anyway, let’s see what happen after replacing the play sound block.

* Yea! This time, as soon as we click Pico, it says “Hello” and make the creaking sound at the same time! Awesome! But why the difference here? Well, did you notice the two words “until done” in the “play sound until done” block? Do you see the words in the new “start sound” block? No! And the secret lies right here. “Unitl done” in the “play sound” block means, “I’m going to play the sound, it could be a short one or a long one, but doesn’t matter how long it is, you need to let me finish the entire sound track before moving on to the next block”. So, when we were using it previously in the script, when this script is run, the Alien Creak1 sound is going to be played, and the script is not going to run the next say block until the sound is done. That explains why we hear the sound first, and only see the speech bubble after it is done playing. Now, what about the “start sound” block without the “until done”? Well, this means “I’m going to start the sound, it could be a short one or a long one, but doesn’t matter how long it is, as soon as I start, you could move on to run the next block!”. Can you see the difference? In this case, the script do not need to wait until the sound is done playing, it can start running the next say block as soon as the sound starts playing. As a result, we are seeing the speech bubble and hearing the sound at the same time. Now, both blocks are useful in different situation, just because we use “start sound” here does not mean it is appropriate in all cases. Later on in the course, we will see both being used. Right now, I just want you to understand the subtle differences between them so you are able to pick the right one.

* Right, before we move on, I just want to do some cleanup. Since the “play sound until done” block is not going to be used here, let’s just drag and delete it. Also, if you click the “Sounds” tab again, since we no longer need the pop sound for our sprite, let’s delete it from the list by clicking this little trash can icon here. And we are only left with the Alien creak1 sound. If you now go back to the code again and bring up the dropdown menu of the “start” sound block, you would see that the pop sound is gone, we only have the Alien Creak1 and record. Cool!

But you might say “wait when we change backdrops, I clearly remember that the one in the middle was “Backdrops”, why it is “Costumes” now?” Yes, you are absolutely right! If you take a look at the sprite list, you can see that we have the sprite Pico currently selected, right? Now, pay attention to the middle tab when I click and select the backdrop. Do not blink your eyes! Aha, see that? The middle tab is now changed to “Backdrops” when the backdrop is selected. So the thing is, you always have the Code and Sounds tab,  |
| Add Nano | * Ok, it’s time to add some friends for Pico! Its first friend is called “Nano” and this sprite also comes with Scratch. Still remember how to add a new sprite? Yes, go to the big plus button in the lower right corner here, and select “Choose a Sprite”. This brings us back to the sprite library. Just like Pico, we can find Nano under the “Fantasy” category, so let’s click that. Nano is right here and click it to add to our project. Now, our sprite list has two sprites, Pico and Nano. Nao is currently being selected, and since it’s a new sprite, it does not have any scripts in the script area yet. We want to place Nano somewhere in the middle the stage, so let’s drag and move it here, that looks good.  |
| Nano switches costumes | * Ok, at the beginning of the lesson, we have seen that Nano, once clicked, expressed “Thank you” by lifting both of its arms. But how? How can we get a sprite to animate like this? Before we answer this question, I would like you to watch a very short video first. [Here it is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hio2CGVLihY). OK, essentially we have seem a very short animation about a pencil drawn on a book. This is actually called a “flipbook” because you flip the book to make an animation come to life. Ok, can anyone explain to me how this animation was made? Why flipping it makes it look like an animation? Yes, here is how it works: the entire book has a series of pencil pictures, each slightly different from the last. When you flip the pages very quickly, they change from one to the next very quickly, and this gives you the impression that the pictures are actually moving, creating a simple animation. It doesn’t matter how simple or complex an animation is, this basic principle stays the same. 

* Ok, back to Scratch. Inspired by the flipbook example, one possible solution to create an arm lifting animation for Nano is to have at least two pictures, one with both arms down, which is the one on stage now, and one with both arms up. If we can then switch the pictures from the arm down one to the arm up one, we would create a very simple arm lifting animation. This sounds pretty good. The only question is, where are those pictures? Well, when we add Pico, we have seen that a sprite can have multiple sound tracks to play. This is like in a piano performance where a pianist can play different pieces. Now, think about a play, an actor can play multiple roles in a single performance, right? What does he/she do to make it look like it is different role? Yes, he/she would change to different costumes for different roles. In Scratch, a sprite is just an actor on the stage, so it can also change how it looks by switching to different “costumes”! So where can we find all the costumes of a sprite? Well, well, well, there a look at the three tabs here again. There is final one that we have not talked about yet: the “Costumes” tab! Make sure you have Nano selected in the sprite list, then click the “Costumes” tab. This brings us to the “Costume Editor”. Look familiar? Yes, it is very similar to the “Backdrop Editor”! Here, you have all the costumes of a sprite in the costume list. Here, there are a total of 4 costumes for Nano: nano-a, nano-b, nona-c and nano-d. The canvas here shows a bigger version of the currently selected costume, which is nano-a. Now, if we click the other three costumes one by one, you can see that each one is different. For example, in the second costume, Nana is laughing, in the third costume Nano is lifting both of its arms and in the final costume, Nano looks a bit angry. Again, in the “Costume Editor”, you can use all the tools here to change the costume image, but I’m happy with what we have now, so I would not change anything here. 

* OK, looks we have the two pictures we need for Nano to express “Thank you”. The first picture is costume“nano-a” where it has both arms down, and the second picture is costume “nano-b” where it has both arms up. The only thing left to be done is to write the code to change Nano’s costume. Let’s click the “Code” tab to get back to the main editor. OK, before write the code for Nano, I have notice something strange: looks like Nano is very angry now, what is going on? Let’s go the “Costume Editor” again. Aha, see, what is the currently selected costume for Nano? Yes, it’s the last one, the angry one. We left this one selected when going back to the main editor, and that’s why Nano has put on its angry face. To get Nano look like before, we just need to make sure that the first costume, nano-a, is selected before clicking the “Code” tab. Now, everything is back to normal.

* Ok, time to work on the code for Nano. First of all, like Pico, we want Nano to lift its arms when it is clicked. Now, we already know how this can be done, right? Anyone? Yes, under the events category, there is a hat block called “when this sprite is clicked”. We use this block to start the script for Pico when it is clicked. We can use it again here for Nano. Drag and place it in the script area. Next, what should we do when Nano is clicked? Yes, we want to change its costume to the the one with both arms lifted up. Still remember which costume is that? Yes, it is the one called “nano-c”. So the next question is how can we change Nano’s costume to this one instead? Currently, it’s on costume ”nano-a”. Well, changing the costume of a sprite changes what is looks right? And of all the block categories, can you find the one that might have to do with the look of a sprite? Yes, the “Looks” category! Let’s click that and it brings us to all the purple blocks. We have seen and used one block from here before, the “say for seconds” block. Now, can you find anything that might be useful for changing a sprite’s costume? Aha, there is a block named “switch costume to”, this one looks very promising! Let’s bring that into our script area. Now, like the “play sound until done” or the “start sound” blocks, this one also has a drop down menu. Let’s click it and see what we get. Aha, there are four options: nano-a, nana-b, nano-c and nano-d. Hmmm…have we seem these somewhere before? Yes, we have seem them in the costume editor. They are basically the four costumes of Nano! Let’s say I select “nano-d”. Now, this entire blocks read “switch costume to nano-d”. What do you think would happen if I click the block and run it now? Yes, it should change Nano to a very unhappy face. Let’s try. Yep, Nano, looks angry now. What if I choose “nano-c” instead? Yes, Nano, should then life both its arms up. Let’s try. Yep, Nano is happy again and have both its arms in the air! OK, let‘s choose “nano-a” again to put Nano back to its starting costume. 

* Ok, with this “switch costume to” block, what do you think we should do when Nano is clicked? Yes, we should just run this block and switch Nano to the costume with both arms lifted. So let’s connect this block with the hat block, and select “nano-c” from the menu. Cool. Let’s try to see if this works.

* Test. Click Nano, and there you go, it lifted both of its arms to express “Thank you”. Nice! 

* Right, in the case of Pico, after it said “Hello” for two seconds, the speech bubble disappears. The creaking sounds also stops once it has finished playing. The next time we click it, Pico says “Hello” and plays the sound again. How about Nano? After it lifted both arms and expressed “Thank you”, the arms stay in the air forever! This means once you switch a sprite to a particular costume, it would just keep that costume from then on and never go back to the first costume again. Now, if we click Nano again, nothing would be changed. Because this script just tries to switch the costume to “nano-c” again, which Nano already has. An animation that can only be played once is not very useful, is it? So what should we do? Any idea? Aha, yes, we should just put the arms back down again at the end of script. So each time Nano is click, it always starts with both arms down. To but both arms down, we just need to connect another “switch costume to” block at the end of end of the script to change the costume back to “nano-a”.

* Problem: Hmmm….after this change, it seems things are getting worse! Previously, Nano can at least lift its arms, but now, no matter how many times we click it, nothing happens! What is going on here? 

* Solution: Well, the reason is because computer programs run very very very fast. Now, one of the biggest reasons that people use computer is because they can do certain things much much quicker than a human can. This saves time and makes us more productive. But it can also cause issues sometimes, like the the one we have here. The reason it seems that Nano is not doing anything is because it is doing the things too quick. When Nano is clicked, it first switches to the costume with both arms up, this is faster than a fraction of a second, then it very quickly switches to the costume with both arms down, again, it is also faster than a faction of a second. So the two movement, lifting the arms and putting them back down is completed in a very short amount of time. Now, our human eyes have some limitation when it comes to detecting changes. If the change happens too fast, to our eyes and brains, it is as if the change has not happened at all. This is sometimes called the “Scratch Blink Issue” and it is what causes our problem here.  

* Ok, after understanding the issue, can you think of a solution? Well if it is because things are happening too fast, then how about making it slower? Maybe that would work? But how can we make Scratch run slower? Well, think about talking to someone who speaks really really fast, so fast that you cannot even keep up with him/her. What would you do? Yes, you might politely say “wait, wait, wait, can you slow down a bit?” So you ask them to “wait”. And you know what, you can also ask Scratch to wait! For this, we need to meet a new block under the “Control” category called “wait seconds”. Now, I don’t think I need to explain it any further because its name is pretty clear. Whenever it is run, it just stop the script and wait for some number of seconds. Exactly how long? Well it all depends on the number you provide in its slot. The default is one second. 

* Now, we know how to get the script to stop and wait. The next question is where should we stop and wait? Well, our problem was that, after Nano lifted its arms, it put them back down too quickly. So to slow down things, we want to wait for bit after lifting the arms and before putting them back down. This means, we need to insert the “wait” block between the two “switch costume” blocks. Right, let’s test this again!

* Test. Aha, yes, we can now see Nano’s movement, it lifted both arms, hold them up for 1 second and then put them back down. Very nice! Exactly what we want. But there is just a small issue, I think the wait time is a little bit too long. Let’s change the number in the wait block slot to 0.5. This is a decimal number, and it represents half of a second. So we cut the wait time by half. Let’s try again. Yeah, I think it looks more natural this time! Awesome! |
| Add Giga | * OK, both Pico and Nano are ready, time for the last friend Giga. Now, I want you to find Giga in the sprite library, add it to our project and place it at the right side of the stage. You have 5 minutes to do that, off you go! Ok, time’s up! Everybody got it done? Yes? Let’s me know if you have trouble doing it. OK, very good, seems all of you have found Giga. Well done! So while you guys are going it, I have also added Giga. Now we have all three friends on the stage!  |
| Giga thinks and changes color | * So let’s take a look again at the finished project and see what Giga does when it is clicked. Aha, two things happened: Giga has a thought bubble that says “Hmmm….”, meaning it’s thinking, and it also changes its color. This is the way Giga shows everybody that it’s thinking now. Let’s see how these two can be done in Scratch code.

* Since Giga also does its stuff when being clicked, which block do you think we should add to the script area first? Yes, the “when this sprite is clicked” hat block. OK, this is the same as the other two sprites, easy!

* Now, it’s time to think! For Pico, it says “Hello” in a speech bubble. And this is done by using the say block under the “Looks” category. Now, Giga’s thought bubble looks kind of similar to the speech bubble. So where do you think we can find the blocks to show it? Aha, yes, if you just look a bit further down in the Looks category, you would see two blocks that start with the word “think”. This looks promising! And actually, they are very similar to the two say blocks: they both have slots to put in what to think about and they also have two different kinds, one with the seconds and one without. The difference between these two kinds are the same as the two say blocks. The one with the seconds only shows the thought bubble for a number of seconds before it goes away, while the the one shows the though bubble forever. For Giga, just like Pico, we do not want the thought bubble to stay on the stage forever, so let’s drag the “think for seconds” block to our script area. Since we want Giga to think when it is clicked, let’s connect this block to the hat block. Let’s test this out!

* Test. Click giga and yes, we see a thought bubble that says “Hmmm…” and then after about 2 seconds, it goes away. So that’s done.

* Now, the second thing Giga does is to change its color. Now, in Scratch, whenever you want a sprite to do something, for example, to move, to make some noise or to change color, you need to first think about what is this action all about. Is it about the motion of the sprite, or the sound of the sprite, or the looks or the sprite, or something else. This helps you to figure which block category you might want to look into to find the right block. For example, if you want to move a sprite, then most likely, you would find something useful in the Motion category. Now, here, we want Giga to change its color. And color is all about how the sprite looks, right? So which block category do you think we should look at? Yes, the Looks category. Now, we have narrowed down our options to only these purple blocks. Next, we can search here to see which one might do the job. Can you find any? Aha, there are two that seem to have something to do with colors: “change color effect by” and “set color effect to”.  Let’s drag both into our script area. 

* First, we can see that both blocks have a menu. If we click and open up the menus, you can see that both have the same 7 options. Actually, these two blocks can not only be used to change the color of a sprite, they can also be used to change how a sprite looks in other ways. This is the reason why both blocks have the word “effect”, because they are not just changing color, but creating many different “Graphical Effects”. We will be learning and using some of these effects in future lessons. For, let’s stick with the color effect. 

* Now, both blocks also have a slot that you can provide some number. Let’s take a look at the “set color effect to block” forst. What does the number here mean? Well, you can simply think of each color having an unique number. The default number is 0 and it is the original color of Giga. Now, let me change that to 50 and click the block, see? Giga changes to a greenish color. How about 100, aha, it now changes to cyan. So for setting color, you can pass a number from 0 all the way to 200. You can try it yourself after class. Next, how about the “change color effect by” block? What does the number here mean? Well, it simple adds this number to the current color number of the sprite. For example, if Giga’s color is 100, then changing it by 25 sets its color to 125. This is the same as providing 125 to the “set color effect to” block. Ok, here we are going to use the “set color effect” block to change Giga’s color, so let’s delete the other one. For the color number, you can use any thing between 0 and 200. I’m just going to pick 100.

* OK, next, we need to add this block to our script so that Giga not only thinks but also changes color. Now, we have two options, we can add this block before or after the think block. So question for you, where do you think we should add it? Before or after? Not sure? Let’s try after first.

* Test. Click Giga, we see the thought bubble, but the color has not been changed. Now, the bubble is gone and the color has changed to cyan. Hmmm…there seems to be some delay between clicking the sprite and changing its color? Can anyone explain why? Aha, yes, because the think block makes Giga think for 2 seconds before moving on to run the next block. And what is the next block? Yes, it’s the set color block. So the color is not going to be changed until the thought bubble disappears. Right, if this is what you want, totally fine. There is nothing wrong with the code. But for me, I want the color to be changed as soon as the sprite is clicked. What should I do then? Yes, we just need to put the set color block before the think block. But before we click Giga and try this out, there is a new problem: Giga is already cyan now. If we click it, the color is going to be set to 100 which is still cyan, meaning we are not going to see any color change. Hmmm…this looks similar to another problem we came across earlier on! Can any still recall what that was? Yes, for Nano, after its arms are lifted, they stay there forever, so if we did not put them down, then the next time we click Nano, nothing is going to happen. Same here, once we changed Giga’s color to Cyan, it will have that color forever if we do not reset to its original color. In this case, nothing is going to happen if we click Giga again. So the solution is to reset Giga’s color at the end of the script. As I said earlier, the starting color value of a sprite is always 0, so to reset Giga’s color, we just need to add another “set color” block and type in 0 in the slot. Now, as soon as Giga finishes thinking, it’s color is changed back to red. Next time we click it, it’s going to change to cyan again. Problem solved! Now, this is one way of do it. A better way is to use a block called “clear graphic effects” in the Looks category. Remember all the effects, including color, that you can set for a sprite in this dropdown menu? Sometimes, we might be setting a lot of different effects on a sprite. Now, if for some reason, you want to get the sprite back to its original look, resetting each effect one by one can be pretty annoying. To make things easier, Scratch has this “clear graphic effects” block that you can use at any time to clear all the effects you have set before in one go. Super simple! Let’s replace the last set color block by this “clear graphic effects” block. Test it again by clicking Giga, the color is changed to cyan, and as soon as the thought bubble disappears, the color is back to red. Everything still works as before, perfect!  |
| Summary | * OK, that’s it, that’s our very first Scratch project! We have three little aliens on a planet, and each of them has a different way to communicate and express themselves. |
